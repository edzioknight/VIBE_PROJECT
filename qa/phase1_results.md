# QA Phase 1 Testing Results - In Progress

## Current Progress (50% Complete)

### API Contract Testing
- ✅ **Authentication Endpoints**: Verified functionality of `/api/v1/auth/send-otp`, `/api/v1/auth/verify-otp`, and `/api/v1/auth/google-signin`
- ✅ **Token Management**: Confirmed proper implementation of token refresh, logout, and multi-device logout
- ✅ **Signup Flow Endpoints**: Validated all onboarding step endpoints from basic-info through photos
- 🔄 **User Profile Endpoints**: Currently testing profile retrieval and update functionality

### Business Logic Testing
- ✅ **OTP System**: Confirmed 6-digit codes, 5-minute expiration, and 3-attempt limit
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Verified 3 OTP requests per 60 seconds enforcement
- 🔄 **Age Validation**: Testing 18+ requirement enforcement
- 🔄 **Photo Upload Validation**: Testing file size, format, and aspect ratio requirements

### UI/UX Flow Testing
- 🔄 **Authentication Flow**: Currently testing sign-in, sign-up, and OTP verification screens
- ⏳ **Onboarding Flow**: Pending testing of step progression and form validation
- ⏳ **Error Handling**: Pending testing of network errors and form validation

### Security Testing
- 🔄 **JWT Tokens**: Testing token security and validation
- ⏳ **Input Validation**: Pending testing of client-side validation
- ⏳ **File Upload Security**: Pending testing of photo upload security

## Initial Findings

### Successes
- OTP generation and verification working correctly
- JWT token management properly implemented
- Rate limiting functioning as specified
- User existence check before OTP working correctly

### Issues Identified
- No critical issues found so far
- Minor UI spacing issue on OTP input field for small screens (to be investigated further)

## Next Steps
1. Complete testing of user profile endpoints
2. Finish business logic validation for age requirements and photo uploads
3. Proceed with UI/UX flow testing
4. Conduct comprehensive security testing

This report will be continuously updated as testing progresses.
