# VibesMatch QA Architecture Plan

## Team Identity
**You are the QA Team.** You will create comprehensive test plans and execute testing for the VibesMatch dating app. You will test against the exact specifications defined by the Backend and Frontend teams. You must validate API contracts, business logic, UI flows, and integration scenarios. Do not assume anything. Do not communicate with other teams. If anything is unclear, ask the uploader only.

## Testing Strategy Overview
- **API Contract Testing**: Validate all backend endpoints match specifications
- **Business Logic Testing**: Verify all app rules and restrictions work correctly
- **UI/UX Testing**: Ensure frontend implements all screens and flows properly
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete user journeys end-to-end
- **Performance Testing**: Validate app performance under load
- **Security Testing**: Test authentication, authorization, and data protection

## Test Environment Setup
- **Backend**: Direct API testing against development server
- **Frontend**: React Native app testing on iOS/Android simulators
- **Database**: Isolated test database with controlled data
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connection testing
- **File Storage**: Test image upload/download functionality

## Test Categories

### 1. API Contract Testing
Validate every backend endpoint matches documented specifications:
- **Request Format**: Headers, body structure, authentication
- **Response Format**: Status codes, response structure, error handling
- **Data Validation**: Input validation, type checking
- **Rate Limiting**: Verify rate limits are enforced
- **Authentication**: Token validation, session management

### 2. Business Logic Testing
Verify all app rules and restrictions:
- **Free User Limits**: 20 likes per 12 hours enforcement
- **Premium Features**: Correct feature access based on subscription
- **Super Like System**: Purchase flow, usage tracking, priority boosting
- **Matching Logic**: Message acceptance, reply-based matching
- **Discovery Algorithm**: Activity-based ranking, filter compliance

### 3. UI/UX Flow Testing
Test all user interface flows:
- **Onboarding**: Complete signup process, data persistence
- **Authentication**: Sign in/out flows, token refresh
- **Discovery**: Card display, button interactions, no-swipe requirement
- **Messaging**: Request system, chat interface, real-time updates
- **Profile Management**: Edit restrictions, data validation

### 4. Integration Testing
End-to-end user journey testing:
- **New User Journey**: Sign up → Profile creation → First discovery session
- **Matching Journey**: Send like → Receive like back → Match creation
- **Premium Journey**: Subscribe → Access premium features → Super like usage
- **Messaging Journey**: Send request → Receive acceptance → Chat conversation

### 5. Edge Case Testing
Test boundary conditions and error scenarios:
- **Network Failures**: Offline scenarios, connection drops
- **Invalid Data**: Malformed requests, SQL injection attempts
- **Rate Limit Exceeded**: User hitting usage limits
- **Expired Tokens**: Authentication token expiration handling
- **File Upload Limits**: Image size, format validation

### 6. Performance Testing
Validate app performance:
- **Load Testing**: Multiple concurrent users
- **Discovery Feed**: Large user base performance
- **Message Delivery**: Real-time message latency
- **Image Loading**: Profile photo load times
- **Database Queries**: Query performance under load

## Test Data Management
- **User Profiles**: Create diverse test user profiles
- **Messaging Data**: Test conversations, requests, matches
- **Premium Subscriptions**: Test accounts with different subscription levels
- **Geographic Data**: Users from different locations
- **Activity Patterns**: Simulate different user activity levels

## Testing Tools
- **API Testing**: Postman, Jest for automated tests
- **Mobile Testing**: Detox for React Native E2E testing
- **Performance**: Artillery for load testing
- **Real-time**: Custom WebSocket testing scripts
- **Database**: SQL scripts for data setup/teardown
